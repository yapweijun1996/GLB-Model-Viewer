# GLB Model Viewer

A simple WebGL-based 3D model viewer built with Three.js. This project loads GLB models, provides interactive camera control with OrbitControls, and offers live light adjustments with dat.GUI. It’s perfect for testing your 3D assets or showcasing models on your website.

## Features

- **GLB Model Loading:** Uses Three.js’ GLTFLoader for loading and displaying your GLB models.
- **Interactive Controls:** Explore the scene with OrbitControls.
- **Dynamic Lighting:** Adjust light direction, intensity, and color in real time with dat.GUI.
- **Sun Representation:** Visualize the directional light as a “sun” in the scene.
- **Easy Deployment:** Run locally or deploy using GitHub Pages.

## Customization

- **Lighting:** Modify light parameters via the dat.GUI panel or directly in the code.
- **Camera:** Tweak camera settings in `index.html` to suit your scene.
- **Model:** Replace `ship.glb` with any GLB model. Ensure the file path is correctly updated.
